\section*{Abstract}
Understanding our environment requires not only passively observing sensory samples but also \emph{acting} to seek out useful relationships between our actions and their possible outcomes. Inspired by the principle of visual salience, we introduce the concept of an "ideal participant", which is the active counterpart of a Bayesian ideal observer. During learning, an ideal participant would build a statistical model of its environment while updating its policy (action selection) after each new observation. This action selection requires a tight balance between making correct predictions (accuracy) and providing diverse data to feed the models (diversity).
We assess these principles in a knowledge-oriented action selection task called the "volleyball" task, where participants estimate the causal influence of a player on the outcome of a volleyball game. The behavioral data we have collected suggest that such active sampling strategies do occur in the brain and improve the accuracy of action/outcome models. We show that the balance between accuracy and diversity objectives can lead to specific action selection biases, reflected both in the model and in the experiments.

\section{Problem setting}


Our environment is full of unpredictable events, and the Bayesian brain hypothesis \cite{knill2004bayesian} suggests that our brains build models to better predict these events. This assumption relies on the idea that the sensory environment acts as a source of random events, against which the brain would construct probabilistic models that would enable it to better predict and anticipate these events \cite{friston2005theory}. This is also known as inference, in the sense that the brain would start from a certain number of hypotheses about the state of the environment, and use the available data to confirm or eliminate some of them. A fundamental feature of this inference process is its predictive nature, which means that the brain's predictions can be compared with the actual data \cite{rao1999predictive}. It is generally assumed that these predictions are obtained by sampling the probabilistic model, and that the validity of the model (or of the hypotheses) is compared with the accuracy of the predictions made \cite{griffiths2008bayesian}. The framework of model inference is considered as a plausible mechanism of learning in the brain, where updating the model according to the prediction error is the central operation, based on Bayes' rule \cite{doya2007bayesian}.

%Crucially, at no point does it "see" probabilities; it only sees realizations. 
%This is referred to as (Bayesian) inference. 

From the formal standpoint, learning the statistical structure of the environment is a typical estimation problem \cite{bishop2006pattern}. Its numeric implementation implies doing some prior assumptions on the statistical model to use, and then estimating its parameters under the Bayesian framework from observing samples \cite{gelman1995bayesian}. The parameters of the model play here the role of a hidden variable, that are \emph{inferred} from observing their outcome. In that framework, a typical objective is the maximization of the likelihood of the outcome, given the parameters (Maximum Likelihood Estimate) \cite{myung2003tutorial}, or the maximization of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), a compound objective also considering minimizing the complexity of the model \cite{kingma2013auto,blei2017variational}.

This probabilistic approach has long been used as a plausible mechanism of visual perception, where the statistical distribution of natural images, under the constraint of parsimony, allows to explain the formation of orientation receptive fields in V1 \cite{simoncelli2001natural}, as well as certain "extra-classical" receptive fields \cite{rao1999predictive}. The visual system seems to operate similarly to an "ideal" Bayesian estimator \cite{geisler1989sequential,geisler2008visual}. It is also interesting to note that the same fundamental principles of estimating a latent distribution from a large number of examples is at the core of unsupervised learning, e.g. in variational auto-encoders and image generation \cite{hinton1995wake, kingma2013auto, rombach2022high}.


%Cependant, ce principe d'estimation ne semble pas se cantonner au simple système visuel et apparaît comme un mécanisme très général grâce auquel le cerveau adapte de manière flexible ses choix et ses réponses aux données de l'environnement \cite{friston2010free}. Si l'estimation de données et la prédiction semblent constituer le mécanisme à travers lequel sont traitées les données sensorielles \cite{knill2004bayesian}, il semble, de manière plus fondamentale, que ce même principe pourrait également s'appliquer à la sélection de l'action . Il existe en effet une correspondance classique entre la sélection de l'action et l'estimation, en particulier dans le cadre du contrôle optimal basé sur les modèles, pour lesquels le modèle de la commande s'appuie sur le modèle de l'environnement \cite{}.

However, this principle of estimation through a generative model does not seem to be confined to the visual system alone and appears as a general mechanism by which the brain flexibly adapts its choices and responses to environmental data . If data estimation and prediction seem to constitute the mechanism through which sensory data is processed, it seems, in a more fundamental way, that this same principle could also be applied to action selection \cite{friston2010free}. 

\begin{itemize}
\item On the one side, there is a classic correspondence between action selection and estimation, particularly in the context of model-based optimal control, where the control model rests on inverting the (forward) model of the environment \cite{todorov2001optimal,kording2004bayesian}. More indirectly, in the model-free context, learning the policy rests on selecting an action that will maximize the cumulative sum of rewards which, in the simple bandit case, resumes to maximizing the outcome itself \cite{sutton1998introduction}. Interestingly, a statistical Bayesian framework may also conduct to consider the policy as a parametric \emph{probability on action}, with maximizing the outcome interpreted as maximizing the (log)-likelihood of the policy (in a policy parametric space) [Levine].

%Then, predictive coding \cite{rao1999predictive} reflects the capacity of sampling those probabilities to predict what we'll sense. 
\item On the other side, as our body's movements affect what we sense, the active inference framework assumes that we  learn by making purposeful moves to understand our surroundings better \cite{friston2012perceptions} . %We choose our actions based on estimating information or prediction errors. 
Interestingly, in that framework, the goal is not only to minimize errors in our predictions, but also maximizing novelty or surprise, in order to seek out information, a concept known as Bayesian surprise \cite{ITTI20091295}. Maximizing novelty (that is current prediction error) is indeed important if one expect to better understand one's environment and avoid future misinterpretations. This search of novelty %as an interpretation of movement selection 
was first proposed by Itti and Baldi \cite{ITTI20091295}, telling that the eye is attracted by the part of the visual scene that is the most surprising regarding the current data model. Put in a Bayesian framework, this corresponds to maximizing model update, given the available data, measured here as a Kullback-Leibler divergence between the old and the new models, seen as a proxy for the prediction error \emph{reduction} after observing new data. This quantification of novelty appeared later on to have a pivotal role in the theory of active inference, where it is referred as the ``epistemic value'' of sensory data [REF]. Say in short, one should put attention to the prediction errors that significantly contribute to minimizing future prediction errors. 

%[LINK WITH INFORMATION THEORY]
% Tishby and Polani introduced the concept of empowerment within the framework of information theory as a measure of an agent's ability to influence its future state through its actions. Empowerment is quantified by the channel capacity between an agent's current actions and its future states, effectively measuring the entropy of the future states that the agent can achieve \cite{tishby2011information, polani2006formal}. This concept is closely related to the information bottleneck principle, which aims to find a compressed representation of an input variable that preserves the most relevant information about an output variable \cite{tishby2000information}. In the context of empowerment, the goal is to maximize the mutual information between actions and future states, akin to maximizing relevant information in the information bottleneck framework. By maximizing empowerment, an agent adopts behaviors that enhance its control and adaptability, making it more robust and flexible in dynamic environments \cite{klyubin2005empowerment}. These ideas have significant implications for developing autonomous systems in robotics and artificial intelligence, providing a theoretical basis for adaptive and resilient behavior.

%This principle can be generalized by assuming that our sensory environment

Moreover, the magnitude of the prediction error made by the model, in other words the "surprise", is related to the concept of entropy and information: data is more informative the more it deviates from the expected distribution. In a sensorimotor context, Tishby and Polani have shown that an agent has the capability to control information by maximizing the entropy of the distribution of observed states through its actions \cite{polani2014}. More precisely, they introduce the concept of ``Empowerment'', which refers to the capacity of the ``communication channel'' between the agent's actions and the observed states.
In the context of Empowerment, the goal is to maximize the mutual information between actions and future states, akin to maximizing relevant information in the information bottleneck framework \cite{tishby2000information}.
\end{itemize}

Importantly, the two principal objectives, i.e. either reaching nominal response or maximizing information, are not necessarily compliant, which is reminiscent of the  "exploration/exploitation trade-off", at the core of reinforcement learning \cite{sutton1998introduction}. However, quite surprisingly, no satisfactory solution has emerged to date to conciliate model learning (through information seeking) with optimal policy learning.
%[les developpements mathématiques de ces idées conduisent à une situation plutot confuse où de nombreux modèles concurrents de surprise sont employés, souvent dans le cadre de l'optimisation motrice / sélection de l'action, sans qu'il soit évident de les départager. La démarche adoptée dans cet article consiste à analyser dans le détail une situation de choix d'action motivée par l'apprentissage d'une relation de cause à effet entre les actions choisies par le sujet et les effets attendus. Il ne s'agit pas ici de maximiser une récompense future, mais plutot de développer la connaissance la plus précise possible du lien entre les choix faits et leurs conséquences observables, en présence de bruit. Dans ce cadre extrêmement simplifié, nous verrons que l'utilisation d'un modèle hiérarchique permet de rendre compte des principales quantités d'intérêt à l'oeuvre dans les modèles de sélection de l'action, et de les comparer, en tant que modèles de décision, aux choix réellement effectués par des sujets humain. En particulier, l'utilisation  de données electrophysiologiques (MEG) permettent de mettre en évidence les réseaux cérébraux à l'oeuvre dans la prise en compte de ces différentes quantités.]
More detrimentally, the developments of these ideas lead to a rather confusing situation where many competing models of surprise are employed (i.e. Bayesian surprise, Variational Free Energy, Empowerment etc.), either through motor optimization, action selection or in decision making, without it being obvious how to differentiate between them. {\color{magenta} Ironically, list of more than XX possible surprise metrics has even been proposed recently [ref gerstner]}. The approach adopted in this article involves a detailed analysis of a situation where action choice is motivated by learning a cause-effect relationship between the subject's chosen actions and the expected effects. This is not about maximizing future rewards but rather about developing the most precise knowledge possible of the link between choices made and their observable consequences, in the presence of noise. In this extremely simplified framework, we will see that using a hierarchical Bayesian model accounts for the main quantities of interest in action selection models and allows for comparison, as decision models, with the actual choices made by human subjects \cite{todorov2002optimal}. In particular, the use of electrophysiological data (MEG) highlights the brain networks involved in considering these different quantities \cite{brookes2011measuring}.

%It was proposed by Itti and Baldi  that the eye is attracted by the part of the visual scene that is the most surprising regarding the (sensory) data model. 
%This principle can be generalized by assuming that our sensory environment
%is mostly interpreted through acting (first) and (then) observing the sensory consequences of our actions. 
%This model-oriented action selection principle is consistent with a Bayesian observer that requires more data to construct his model. 
%More recently, it was proposed by  that the brain may act as a scientific investigator, that would select an action so as to validate (or dismiss) a current hypothesis about the state of the environment.  
%In that case, the difference between the model predictions and the actual sensory observations serves as a metric to interpret the current observation as more or less surprising, 
%and adapt either the model or the action selection so as to minimize the global surprise (that is the surprise over both past and future observations).

%    Originality

%Taking inspiration from Itti and Baldi saliency principle, the idea here is to select actions in a way that should maximize the knowledge about the data model. Let $\pi$ be the \emph{policy}, i.e. an adaptive action selection strategy, and let $\theta$ be the parameters of a data model, that reflects the distribution of expected sensory observations and outcomes observed after an action $a$. Let  $s \in \mathcal{S}$ be the state observed after an action $a$ is actuated.
%Then $p(s|a, \theta)$ is a parametric model of state transitions, that describes the expected distribution of outcomes given an action and the parameters. In a Bayesian setup, $\theta$ is interpreted as a latent variable that explains the current observation. Then, let $q(\theta)$ be a distribution over the latent parameters (posterior distribution) that is updated after each observation. In the simplest case, $p$ is a Bernouilli distribution and $q$ is a beta model over the the (single) parameter of $p$. 

% In model-based reinforcement learning, the statistical relationships between the actions and their outcomes inform the policy for the choice of the action. These statistical relationships can be given in advance, or learned from experiencing action/outcome samples. In the last case, the choice of action (policy) reflects a balance to be kept between two concurrent objectives, one objective being the building of an accurate model of the world, the second one being the maximization of the (cumulative) rewards. The difficulty in balancing exploration and exploitation, in the absence of a definite model, is at the heart of reinforcement learning problems. 



%On the other sie, l }

\subsubsection{Bayesian ideal observer}



A Bayesian ideal observer experiments the statistical structure of its environment from observing a series of samples, without intervening on it. It generally assumes a parametric model $\theta$ to explain the observations $y_1, y_2, ...$, with each $y_t$ assumed a sample of $p(Y|\theta)$, $\theta$ being unknown.

%It belongs to the family of variational inference algorithms. The model assumes that a . Here the set of parameters $\theta$ take the role of a hidden variable. 
At every step of the process, the agent forms an estimate of the parameters, $p(\Theta|h_t, y_t)$ with $h_t$ the sequence of past observations and $y_t$ the current observation. Then, the update of the model rests on applying Bayes formula on the new data using the chain rule: $p(\Theta|h_t, y_t) \propto p(y_t|\Theta) p(\Theta|h_{t-1}, y_{t-1}) $.
 
In the case of a Bernouilli series of inputs, the update of a simple Beta model $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$ (see previous sections) can be shown to follow that of a Bayesian ideal observer. 

It is to be noticed that, by construction, an observer does not intervene onto the data it observes. It is a pure passive method of estimation.

\subsection{Controlling the data}

Hypothesis: Actions serve to sample sensory data.
Body movements (actions) are a source of sensory changes
Active learning: actions aim to better understand (infer) data.
Minimization of posterior prediction error (Active inference): via maximization of novelty (Bayesian surprise).

%The hypothesis that actions serve to sample sensory data posits that body movements are sources of sensory changes, facilitating active learning by enhancing data inference. According to this view, actions are not merely responses to external stimuli but are proactive processes aimed at gathering information about the environment. By actively engaging with their surroundings, organisms can improve their understanding and predictions of environmental states \citep{clark2013whatever}.
Active learning suggests that the purpose of actions is to minimize uncertainty by continuously updating internal models based on new sensory inputs. This process is akin to hypothesis testing, where the brain generates predictions and then tests these predictions against actual sensory data. Such an approach allows the brain to refine its models, making them more accurate and reliable over time. % \citep{sutton2018reinforcement}.
%The concept of active inference further elaborates on this hypothesis by proposing that actions are aimed at minimizing posterior prediction error. This is achieved through the maximization of novelty or Bayesian surprise, where the brain seeks out new and unexpected sensory data to reduce uncertainty in its predictive models. By continually seeking out novel experiences, the brain can challenge and update its models, ensuring they remain relevant and effective \citep{friston2010action}.
%This framework suggests that the brain operates in a constant loop of prediction and correction, where prediction errors signal the need for model adjustment. The minimization of prediction error through active inference is a core principle of this model, relying on the Bayesian framework to update beliefs and predictions \citep{rao1999predictive}. This dynamic interaction with the environment is essential for maintaining a high level of adaptability and for optimizing behavior in a constantly changing world \citep{friston2015active}.

In summary, the hypothesis that actions serve to sample sensory data underscores the importance of proactive engagement with the environment in sensory perception and cognitive function. Through active learning and the minimization of prediction errors, organisms can refine their internal models, better anticipate changes in their surroundings, and enhance their overall adaptability and survival.



On contrary to an observer, a reinforcement learning algorithm exerts a \emph{control} on the data it collects. Like in Thompson sampling, the observer may thus be an element of a larger estimation process that would take action over and causal relations within the data into consideration. 

Though generally assumed to maximize the reward expectation, the sampling of the data remains an important part of the process. It has been the subject of an abundant literature in the RL and robotics community, in order to go beyond the baseline uniform sampling on actions ($\varepsilon$-greedy). This comprise different variants of novelty detection, learning improvement and curiosity metrics [REFS]. Such exploration-incentive metrics remain however quite arbitrary and ``hand-made'', and remain difficult to incorporate into the RL optimization framework. 

Assuming $\theta$ a current statistical model explaining the past observations, we consider here  the process that selects new data in order to feed the model. In principle, one should choose a sample that would reduce the prediction error, i.e. increase the likelihood of the next observations after the model has been updated. 
%reduce the entropy of the posterior, expressed as a KL-divergence between posterior and the prior of the model's belief, a quantity known as the ``Bayesian surprise'' [REF]. Using Bayes formula, it closely corresponds to the . %Incidentally, the expected prediction error itself (before updating the model) is often used as a proxy for future model improvements, explaining the natural attraction toward random/unpredictable outcomes [REF].

In the simple scenario considered here, the outcome is assumed to be the result of a generative process combining the selection of the player $x_t$, and the generation of the outcome $y_t$, assuming the following mixture generative model $y_t \sim  p(Y_t|\Theta_t)$ with $\theta_t$ a hidden parameter that is conditionally dependent on $x_t$ (mixture variable) and the history of past observations $h_t$, i.e. $\theta_t \sim  q(\Theta|x_t, h_t)$. At each step $t$, let $q_{t|t-1}(\Theta)$ be the belief about $\theta_t$ before observing the data sample ($x_t$ and $y_t$) and $q_{t|t}(\Theta)$ be the belief about $\theta_t$ after observing the sample. Then maximizing the Information gain (or learning progress) is equal to maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence:
\begin{align}\label{eq:BS}
\text{max}_{x_t}\text{KL}(q_{t|t}(\Theta)||q_{t|t-1}(\Theta))
\end{align}
reflecting the model update (knowledge improvement) before and after observing the data.
%As time passes, the belief should converge to a point distribution and the Bayesian surprise should converge to zero.

This conducts to biasing the selection of action in favour of data that would maximises the update of the model [REF]. However, predicting the information gain is more complex than just predicting the average outcome. In a Thompson sampling setup, where each arm is associated with a Beta model, estimating the information gain for each arm requires (i) first sampling the current model, then (ii) generating an outcome for each arm by sampling the generative model, and finally (iii) estimating the belief update. [ALGORITHM?]. This approach is consistent with the predictive coding principle [REF], interpreted here as \emph{predicting the prediction error}.

Additionally, one can also provide a statistics over action selections from observing choices over time. This is the case, for instance, for a coach that would select (or not) a player for matches. Assume now that $\phi=(\pi, \theta)$ with $\pi$ a parameter for action selection (reflecting a proportion of action, i.e. ``PLAY'' or ``NOT PLAY'') and $\theta$ a parameter for predicting the outcome (i.e. ``WIN'' or ``LOSE''). Here $\pi$ would reflect the choices of the coach, and $q(\PI)$ (action selection statistics) could be updated at each step. %Knowing $\theta_x$ would help to provide a more comprehensive model of the way the observations are generated. 
Then, each observation of $y_t$, knowing $x_t$, would allow to improve the generative model by: \begin{align}\label{eq:BS-joint}
\text{max}_{x_t}\text{KL}(q_{t|t}(\Pi, \Theta)||q_{t|t-1}(\Pi, \Theta))
\end{align}
reflecting both the knowledge improvement about the coach's  behavior and match's outcome after observing the data sample.

Importantly here,  an additional element (reward information) comes into the play. In our case,  $y_t$ would indicate whether the choice was correct or incorrect (``WIN'' or ``LOSE''). %In a RL setup, this can be interpreted as an incentive to bias the coach's choice (i.e $\theta_x$) in favor of a policy parameter that would increase the probability of winning. 
Consider for instance $\theta$ being the ``WIN'' expectation of a Bernoulli distribution. Assuming $\pi$ being the ``PLAY'' expectation, then taking $\pi \propto\exp(\theta)$ would be consistent with biasing the selection of action toward maximizing the ``WIN'' expectation [ref Levine]. More generally, %assuming such strategy should be adopted by the coach, 
this correspondence may be given by $q(\Pi|\Theta)$, i.e. a belief about $\pi$ (action selection) given the belief about $\theta$ (the outcome i.e. the action validity). Injecting this relation into equation (\ref{eq:BS-joint}) may thus allows to incorporate reward information into the information gain maximization. This would conduct to a concurrent (or dual) optimization, reflecting both knowledge and action validity improvement (see also \cite{dauce2022concurrent}).
%Then assuming $q_{t|t-1}(\Pi)$ the current belief (obtained from observing the coach's choices), one should consider maximizing:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:BS-cond}\text{max}_{x_t}\text{KL}(q_{t|t}(\Pi|\Theta)||q_{t|t-1}(\Pi)) 
%\end{align}
%the information gain about the behavior, reflecting the (expected) behavior improvement expected from considering outcomes. 

%The complementary conditional distribution is $q(\Theta|Q)$ (a belief about $\theta$ given a belief about $Q$).
%In a predictive setup, one can now predict the next update of $\Theta$ knowing the current belief on $Q$. This is noted $q_t(\Theta,Q) = q_t(\Theta|Q)q(Q) $ = a winning probability, then one can assume . Assuming 
%$$\text{KL}(q_{t}(Q|\Theta)||q_{t-1}(Q)) + \text{KL}(q_{t}(\Theta)||q_{t-1}(\Theta|Q))$$
%reflecting the separation of the optimization in two terms. The left one reflecting the update of $Q$ after observing $x_t$ and $y_t$, and the right being the data model improvement, knowing $Q$.

%The information gain can be rewritten as: 
%with the left term reflecting the ``matching'' of the coach's choice with the proportion of ``WIN'', and more generally the matching of the behavior with rewards. The putative mismatch between $Q$ and $\Theta$ development of the formula, given in the algorithm, conducts to

%We propose in this paper to extend this principle toward the case of model building in goal-directed action selection tasks: what is the appropriate strategy to choose when the objective is to understand the relationship between different actions and an their outcomes? 
%We consider here a probabilistic setting, where learning is reflected in estimating a conditional distribution $p(S|A)$ (where the outcome $s \in S$ conditionally depends on the action $a \in A$). A typical strategy is trying different actions, observing their outcomes and memorizing the average outcome for each action.  

%We want to understand whether the behavior adopted in information-seeking situations resembles that of saliency-based saccade selection in vision. In vision, the region of interest is the one whose statistics differs the most from the average image statistics, reflecting the information contained in the different parts of an image. 
%I

Inspired by the Bayesian ideal observer \cite{geisler1989sequential}, we thus developed a model of optimal sampling that we call the ``ideal participant''. An ideal participant is defined as an action selection mechanism (an "actor") that is built on top of an ideal observer.
%Let ${D}_{t}=(a_1,s_1), ..., (a_t,s_t)$ be a sequence of observations; a Bayesian observer is a recursive parameter update strategy that relies on Bayes formula, i.e. $q(\theta|\mathcal{D}_n) \propto p(s_n|a_n, \theta) \times q(\theta|\mathcal{D}_{n-1})$. An important element is the initial \emph{prior} $q_0(\theta)$ reflecting the initial guess about the parameters. 
%In an active sampling strategy, one need to consider specific series of actions $(a_1,...,a_n,...)$, and estimate how the corresponding  observations participates in reducing the uncertainty of the observer. 
The role of the observer is to build a  model $\theta$, reflecting the statistics of the outcomes obtained under any action $a$. The role of the actor (participant) is to choose the next action. At each step, the observer informs the actor how good the action $a$ is at reducing the model uncertainty.  The ``value'' of an observation is thus reflected in the information it provides to the model. 
Given a current data model (provided by the ideal observer), the ideal participant can estimate how unexpected the outcome is regarding the model, i.e. $-\log p(s|a,\theta)$, which can be compared to the marginal surprise $-\log p(s|\theta)$. The difference $\log p(s|a,\theta) - \log p(s|\theta)$ is the \emph{Information Gain} provided by the action $"a"$.
Maximizing the information gain turns out, in average,  to
maximizing the Empowerment \cite{Klyubin2005EmpowermentAU}, which is the channel capacity of an action-outcome medium. The concept is different from that of Bayesian surprise \cite{ITTI20091295}, used in classic (Free Energy based) active inference \cite{friston2012perceptions}.

%\begin{equation}
%    \mathcal{E} = \max_\pi \mathbb{E}_{s\sim \pi(A)} \mathbb{E}_{s\sim p(S|a, \theta)} \log p(s|a,\theta) - \log p(s|\theta, \pi) \label{eq:emp}
%\end{equation}
%This conducts to treat $\log p(s|a,\theta) - \log p(s|\theta,\pi)$ as a reward, 
%which corresponds, for a given data model $\theta$, to choose an action that should maximize the difference between the surprise and the \emph{marginal surprise}, with the marginal distribution of states defined as:
%$$ p(s|\theta,\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi(a)} p(s|a,\theta)$$

%Idée : l'équation de l'empowerment représente un point d'équilbre entre deux tendances : l'aversion à l'erreur (le modèle doit être précis dans ses prédictions), ce qui revient à minimiser la surprise, mais également une attirance pour la nouveauté, exprimée par le terme d'entropie de la distribution marginale. Cet équilibre entre deux tendances contradictoires   
Consider now that the objective of the observer (i.e. the brain) is to develop a good understanding (a good model) of its environment. Then, the selection of action will be based on comparing those two information quantities. The positive term  $\log p(s|a,\theta)$ reflects a \emph{precision} objective (that is having low prediction errors), while the negative term $- \log p(s|\theta)$ reflects a sampling diversity objective (state coverage). Only the combination of both may help to provide a comprehensive modeling of the environment. This objective can be attained at the cost of maintaining a general (marginal) model of the observations.   

\section{Experiments}
In order to illustrate the principles exposed, we consider in the following a behavioral task called the "volleyball" task (see figure \ref{fig:1})\cite{basanisi2021neurophysiological}, in which participants are asked to estimate the causal influence of a particular player in making the volley-ball team win or lose the matches. 15 different scenarios are considered. Each scenario is described by two Bernoulli distributions : $p_1=p(s=\text{WIN}|a=\text{PLAY})$ and  $p_0=p(s=\text{WIN}|a=\text{NOT PLAY})$ that reflect the probability to win when the player is selected versus non selected. In a first series of experiments (``experiment A'').  The influence of the player is quantified by the probability difference $\Delta p = p_1 - p_0$, that can vary from strong worsening ($\Delta p = -0.6$ winning probability) to strong improvement ($\Delta p = 0.6$ winning probability). In a second series of experiments (``experiment B''), the influence of the player can only vary from neutral (no change) to strong improvement ($+0.8$ winning probability).
By alternating 'PLAY' and 'NOT PLAY', the human participants obtains samples of 'WIN' and 'LOSE' and are expected to estimate both distributions (which is asked after 40 trials).

\section{Results}
%Ideal observer models  are used to estimate, in perception tasks, how subjects deviate from an optimal response, knowing the parameters of a task. 
We are interested here in the action selection strategies developed by the subjects, and by the action selection \emph{biases}. In such a setup it is easy to show that a close to optimal strategy is to choose the actions 'PLAY' and 'NOT PLAY' in equal proportion. A first and important observation is that human subjects exhibit mostly irregular action selection, resembling that of a Bernoulli draw, rather than a periodic alternation. %A second observation is that they manifest significant biases toward the actions that provide higher rewards (that is the "reward bias"), which reflects a compelling preference to 'WIN' rather than 'LOSE', which is largely expected in this kind of setup (not shown). 

More intriguingly, a significant bias toward entropic (action, outcome) relationships is observed in experiment A only (that is action-outcome relationships that are "difficult" to predict). In order to quantify this entropy bias, the entropy difference $\Delta H = H(p_1) - H(p_0)$, where $H(p)=-\sum_{s \in S}p(s)\log(p(s))$ is the entropy, indicates whether $p_1$ is more (or less) irregular than $p_0$. %The entropy difference bias can be seen as resulting from an imbalance between the precision and the diversity objectives, 
The question comes why such an imbalance is observed in the first experiment and not in the second? We thus simulated an ``ideal participant'' resolving similar tasks.
The ideal observer builds a posterior $q(\theta) = (\beta(n_{\text{WIN}}^{\text{PLAY}}, n_{\text{LOSE}}^{\text{PLAY}}), \beta(n_{\text{WIN}}^{\text{NOT PLAY}}, n_{\text{LOSE}}^{\text{NOT PLAY}}))$, with $\beta$ a beta model with $n_s^a$ being the number of $(a,s)$ observations. The marginal distribution $\beta(n_{\text{WIN}},n_{\text{LOSE}})$ is estimated in addition.
Then, the ideal participant samples $ \tilde{p}_0,  \tilde{p}_1$ from the ideal observer, estimates the marginal $\tilde{p}_\text{m}$, and the action chosen is the one that maximizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence $KL(\tilde{p}_i||\tilde{p}_\text{m})$, with $i$ in $\{0,1\}$.
The differences between experiment A and experiment B are implemented in the \emph{priors} of the ideal observer (see figure \ref{fig:data}), that is the prior of $p_0$, $p_1$ and $p_m$ based on the experiment design. In experiment A, those distributions are identically distributed over the [0.2,0.8] range, while in experiment B, the prior distribution of $p_0$ is skewed to the left, while the prior distribution of $p_1$ is skewed to the right. This single difference has for consequence that the prior of $p_0$ and $p_1$ is less informative in experiment A than in experiment B. This uninformative prior implies a longer training in experiment A than in experiment B, which conducts to place a greater emphasis on the diversity objective. As a result, action selection in experiment A tended towards highly entropic outcomes.

Second row : The ratio of the action "PLAY" generated by the ideal participant, given the prior and the value of $\Delta H$. The difference is significant in Experiment A (left, $p<0.001$). %It means the model selects the action 'Play' when it is more entropic i.e its outcome is more random. 
This is not the case in Experiment B (right, $p>0.05$). Third row: behavioral data collected from participants. (Left) Participants show a significant bias toward more surprising actions (left, $p<0.01$).  (right) No significant difference in action selection. These findings match those of the model.
}
\label{fig:data}
\end{figure}

% This action selection relies on a tight balance between two opposing tendencies, namely (ii) making correct predictions, and (ii) providing sufficiently diverse data to feed the models. 
%An important confounding factor, however, is that Experiment A was conducted with healthy subjects while Experiment B was conducted with epileptic patients, although the behavioral responses were consistent in both types of subjects. 

These results finally confirm our assumptions, suggesting that human subjects may develop information-guided action selection strategies, by combining principles of Bayesian estimation \cite{knill2004bayesian} and action read-out information maximization \cite{Klyubin2005EmpowermentAU}. Furthermore, ongoing research is underway in the laboratory to investigate whether such action-selection principles can be detected in electrophysiological signals.
